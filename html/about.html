        <p>I was born in Westford, Ma on a cold winter night with a mean temperature of 34.8°F. The skies were clear…or so the database says. I was born to a loving mother and father, with one over protective sister. I’ll be honest, growing up my father was the star of the show. As a construction worker, he was always fixing, building, destroying, rebuilding things around our house. This is where I picked up my love for problem solving. He also drew me a life-sized Power Ranger one time and that was really cool.</p>

        <p>I was all over the place growing up. There was a lot of wrestling with the nerd I wanted to be and the athlete I thought I should be. Luckly, I found some amazing friends in highschool through the theater program, Math Honors Society, and Volleyball. I spent much of my time divided between the sciences and the arts and like many teenagers clueless to the question: “What are you going to do for the rest of your life?” Honestly, what a crazy impossible question to put on literal kids.</p>

        <p>In 2007, I was accepted to Northeastern University’s Architecture program. I think as a young impressionable youth I may not have understood the difference between Architecture and Engineering. I loved math and I loved designing. Unfortunately, within a few years I realized how little math Architecture actually contained. I left the program to pursue a degree in Environmental Science. It was here I was first, unknowingly, exposed to Data Science. I learned how to use MatLab, ArcGIS , and other data analytics programs.</p>

        <p>My first internship was for Raytheon as part of an Environmental Engineering team. Again, I was brushed by the Data Science spirit. 
        </p>

        <p>I was given a small task to calculate the water usage of our facility’s bathrooms. I ran with this task, collecting information on every toilet and sink product, scraping data to understand the average usage for employees in certain age brackets and sexes, then compared this to our own employee registry. After calculating the potential total usage, I saw an opportunity. I presented this data to my supervisor, who immediately saw the impact as well.</p>
          
        <p> My project scope increased. I was to continue this task for the entire Northeast region. At the end, I received a formal award from my boss and was asked to present my project to some higher-ups.</p>
          
        <p>After my presentation, I felt completely outclassed. The two other recipients were working on missiles and high-tech radars. However, at the end they all spoke up and said something I’ll mostly never forget (since I'm paraphrasing here) “If you can be given a small project with toilets and find millions of dollars in real savings, your work ethic and enthusiasm knows no bounds.”</p>

        <p>After a few years at Golder, I started consulting work with some friends as a part-time gig. I had never heard of it before, but as soon as I understood, I was hooked. Aquaponics: a process that marries aquaculture and hydroponics. The fish feed the plants and the plants clean the water for the fish. It seemed so simple, so perfect. Rarely are things in the real world ever this simple however. 
        </p>
        <p>I ended up leaving Golder to found Trifecta Ecosystems with these friends. For two years we toiled away researching, designing, and selling systems and services to the Education and Intellectual and Developmentally Disabled sectors. As the COO, I wore many different hats. It was here I learned A/B testing, financial analysis, SEO, google analytics, and many other tools to monitor the success of a business.</p>
        <p>After two years of grinding, we secured funding from Connecticut Regional Water Authority in the form of $500,000. Although we just had our first breakthrough, I felt like I finally took my first breath and realized I wanted to focus on research. To focus on data. I loved the entrepreneurial life, but I longed to focus on research and data analysis.</p>

I’ve published my work with <i>Astyanax mexicanus</i> in two books and presented at several conferences. I’ve been able to use my knowledge to reduce the team’s workload, the cost of the facility, and improve the welfare of our animals. Most importantly, I have been able to train and mentor so many other members of our team and watch them grow and succeed in their careers. </p>
        <p>Exploring both the operations and biological side of data has made it abundantly clear for me, my passion is in data. It can be sperm motility, water quality, equipment states, images, animal survival, growth metrics, whatever. As long as I can wrangle, analyze, and model it…I am happy.</p>
